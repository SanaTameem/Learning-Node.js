# Express.js and REST API Notes 🚀

## What is Express? ⚡

Express is a minimal **Node.js framework** with high-level abstraction. It is built on top of Node.js.

Express allows for **faster development of Node applications** and makes it easy to organize applications in an **MVC architecture**.

**Features:**

- 🛣 Complex routing
- 📬 Easier handling of requests and responses
- 🧩 Middleware
- 🌐 Server-side rendering

## What is an API? (Application Programming Interface) 🔗

An API is a piece of software that is used by another piece of software to allow applications to **communicate with each other**.

**Simple example (Restaurant analogy):**

- 👩 **You** = the customer
- 🧑‍🍳 **Kitchen** = the system/program
- 🧑‍💼 **Waiter** = the API

**In programming:**  
An API allows one application to **request data or services** from another application.

## What is a Web API? 🌍

A **Web API** is simply an API that works over the internet.  
It allows **web applications to communicate with servers using HTTP**.

**Common styles to build APIs:**

- REST API (most popular)
- SOAP API
- GraphQL API

---

## What is a REST (Representational State Transfer) API? 📝

REST is a way of designing APIs using **simple URLs** and **HTTP methods**.

**The 4 main REST methods:**
| Method | Action |
|--------|------------|
| GET | Get data |
| POST | Create data |
| PUT/PATCH | Update data |
| DELETE | Delete data |

---

## Practical REST Design Principles ✅

REST principles make an API **simple, organized, and easy to use**.

### 1️⃣ Separate API into Logical Resources

- Organize data into resources like users, products, or orders.
- Avoid mixing everything in one endpoint.

### 2️⃣ Use Resource-Based URLs

- URLs should describe **what the resource is**, not the action.
- Example:
  - `/users` ✔
  - `/getUsers` ❌

### 3️⃣ Use HTTP Methods to Show Actions (Verbs)

- Use HTTP methods to indicate the action:
  - **GET** → retrieve data
  - **POST** → create data
  - **PUT/PATCH** → update data
  - **DELETE** → remove data

### 4️⃣ Send and Receive Data as JSON

- REST APIs usually use **JSON format** because it’s lightweight and easy to process.

### 5️⃣ Stateless

- Every request must contain all necessary information.
- The server does **not remember previous requests**; each request is independent.

## REST API URL Structure and HTTP Methods 🌐

**Base URL:**  
`https://www.something.com`

| Action                   | Method    | Endpoint                            |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Create a resource        | POST      | `/resource_name`                    |
| Read all resources       | GET       | `/resource_name`                    |
| Read a specific resource | GET       | `/resource_name/{id}`               |
| Update a resource        | PUT/PATCH | `/resource_name/{id}`               |
| Delete a resource        | DELETE    | `/resource_name/{id}`               |
| Get related resource     | GET       | `/resource_name/{id}/resource_name` |

## What is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)? 🗂

- JSON is a **clean, readable way to send data** from one place to another.
- JSON keys should **always be strings**.

---

## What is JSend? 📦

- JSend is a **standard for formatting JSON responses**.
- It has **three types of responses**:
  - `success`
  - `fail`
  - `error`

---

## What is Middleware? 🧩

Middleware is like a **helper function** that runs **between the request and the response**.

Think of it as a **stop on the way** where Express can do something with the request before sending the response.

**In easy words:**

- Middleware takes `req` and `res` (the request and response)
- Does something (like logging, checking authentication, or parsing data)
- Then either **passes control to the next middleware/route** or sends a response

**Everything is middleware in Express**

- Routes, built-in functions, and custom helpers are all treated as middleware in Express.

**Middleware stack**

- Middleware functions are executed **in order — one after another**.
- Think of them as a **stack of tasks**.
- Each middleware does something, then passes control to the next one using `next()`.

**Using middleware in Express**

- Use **`app.use()`** for global middleware
- Pass middleware **directly to a route** for route-specific tasks

## Types of Middleware in Express.js

There are **four main types of middleware**:

1️⃣ **Application-level middleware**

- Defined using `app.use()` or `app.METHOD()`
- Runs for all or specific routes

2️⃣ **Router-level middleware**

- Applied to specific routers using `express.Router()`
- Useful for modularizing routes

3️⃣ **Built-in middleware**

- Provided by Express itself
- Examples:
  - `express.json()` → parse JSON body
  - `express.urlencoded()` → parse URL-encoded form data
  - `express.static()` → serve static files

4️⃣ **Third-party middleware**

- Middleware from npm packages
- Examples:
  - `morgan` → request logger
  - `cors` → enable CORS
  - `cookie-parser` → parse cookies

## Middleware Order in Express.js 🚦

**Recommended order for your app:**

1. **Built-in middleware** (e.g., `express.json()`)
2. **Custom middleware** (e.g., logging, request time)
3. **Third-party middleware** (e.g., `morgan`, `cors`)
4. **Route handlers / Routers** (`app.route()` or `app.get/post/...`)
5. **Error-handling middleware** (defined last)

> ⚡ **Tip:** Middleware runs **in the order it is defined**, top to bottom.
